# Exploring your first application with kubectl
_Type: Lab_

_Duration: 7 mins_

In the previous lab, you used Kubectl command-line  to deploy your application. You'll continue to use it in this lab to get information about the deployed application and it's environments. The most common operations can be done with the following kubectl commands:

* ``kubectl get`` - list resources
* ``kubectl describe`` - show detailed information about a resource
* ``kubectl logs`` - print the logs from a container in a pod
* ``kubectl exec`` - execute a command on a container in a pod

You can use these commands to see when applications were deployed, what their current statuses are, where they are running and what their configurations are.

Now that we know more about our cluster components and the command line, let's explore our application.

## Check Application Configuration
1. Let’s verify that the application we deployed in the previous scenario is running. We’ll use the ``kubectl get`` command and look for existing Pods:
```
kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
myfirstapp-86776c7859-c8kcd   1/1       Running   0          3h
myfirstapp-86776c7859-cdb2v   1/1       Running   0          3h
myfirstapp-86776c7859-jb59l   1/1       Running   0          3h

```
2. To view what containers are inside any of the Pods listed and what images are used to build those containers we run the describe pods command on any of the pods listed:
```
kubectl describe pod myfirstapp-86776c7859-c8kcd
```
```

```

## Get the Logs from a Pod
Anything that the application would normally send to STDOUT becomes logs for the container within the Pod. Make sure you reference a pod that you were able to hit in the previous lab.
1. Let's retrieve these logs using the kubectl logs command:
```
kubectl logs myfirstapp-86776c7859-c8kcd
```
```
10.244.0.1 - - [22/Dec/2017:20:22:39 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 920 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.84 Safari/537.36"
10.244.0.1 - - [22/Dec/2017:20:22:39 +0000] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 200 927 "http://52.179.102.200:8080/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.84 Safari/537.36"
...
```

## Executing commands inside of a container
We can execute commands directly on the container once the Pod is up and running. For this, we use the exec command and use the name of the Pod as a parameter. 
1. Let’s list the environment variables:
```
kubectl exec myfirstapp-86776c7859-c8kcd env
```
```
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
HOSTNAME=myfirstapp-86776c7859-c8kcd
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP=tcp://10.0.0.1:443
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_PROTO=tcp
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_PORT=443
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR=10.0.0.1
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=10.0.0.1
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=443
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS=443
KUBERNETES_PORT=tcp://10.0.0.1:443
HOME=/root
```
2. let’s start a bash session in the Pod’s container:
```
kubectl exec -ti myfirstapp-86776c7859-c8kcd bash
```
3. Now you are in a shell inside the container running in a pod. Now let's list the root directory and cat the README.md file at the root.
```
root@myfirstapp-86776c7859-c8kcd:/# ls
README.md  bin  boot  core  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
root@myfirstapp-86776c7859-c8kcd:/# cat README.md
# Echoserver

This is a simple server that responds with the http headers it received.

Image versions >= 1.4 removes the redirect introduced in 1.3.
Image versions >= 1.3 redirect requests on :80 with `X-Forwarded-Proto: http` to :443.
Image versions > 1.0 run an nginx server, and implement the echoserver using lua in the nginx config.
Image versions <= 1.0 run a python http server instead of nginx, and don't redirect any requests.
root@myfirstapp-86776c7859-c8kcd:/#
```
4. To exit from the container type ``exit``
