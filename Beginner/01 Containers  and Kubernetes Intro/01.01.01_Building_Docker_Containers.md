## Docker Images

Docker images are built based on a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile defines all the steps required to create a Docker image with your application configured and ready to be run as a container. The image itself containers everything, from operating system to dependencies and configuration required to run your application.

Having everything within the image allows you to migrate images between different environments and be confident that if it works in one environment, then it will work in another.

The Dockerfile allows for images to be composable, enabling users to extend existing images instead of building from scratch. By building on an existing image, you only need to define the steps to setup your application. The base images can be basic operating system installations or configured systems which simply need some additional customisations.

All Docker images start from a base image. A base image is the same images from the Docker Registry which are used to start containers. Along with the image name, we can also include the image tag to indicate which particular version we want, by default, this is latest.

These base images are used as the foundation for your additional changes to run your application. For example, if we require NGINX to be configured and running on the system before we can deploy our static HTML files. As such we want to use NGINX as our base image.

Dockerfile's are simple text files with a command on each line. To define a base command we use the command FROM <image-name>:<tag>

**Caution**
It's tempting to use the tag :latest however this can result in you building your image against a version which you were not expecting. We recommend that you always use a particular version number as your tag and manage the updating yourself.

With the base image defined, we need to run various commands to configure our image. There are many commands to help with this, the main commands two are COPY and RUN.

RUN <command> allows you to execute any command as you would at a command prompt, for example installing different application packages or running a build command. The results of the RUN are persisted to the image so it's important not to leave any unnecessary or temporary files on the disk as these will be included in the image.

COPY <src> <dest> allows you to copy files from the directory containing the Dockerfile to the container's image. This is extremely useful for source code and assets that you want to be deployed inside your container.

With our files copied into our image and any dependencies downloaded, you need to define which port application needs to be accessible on.

Using the EXPOSE <port> command you tell Docker which ports should be open and can be bound too. You can define multiple ports on the single command, for example, EXPOSE 80 433 or EXPOSE 7000-8000

With the Docker image configured and having defined which ports we want accessible, we now need to define the command that launches the application.

The CMD line in a Dockerfile defines the default command to run when a container is launched. If the command requires arguments then you need to use an array, for example ["cmd", "-a", "arga value", "-b", "argb-value"], which will be combined together and the command cmd -a arga value -b argb-value would be run.

An alternative approach to CMD is ENTRYPOINT. While a CMD can be overridden when the container starts, a ENTRYPOINT defines a command which can have arguments passed to it when the container launches.

In this example, NGINX would be the entrypoint with -g daemon off; the default command.

After writing your Dockerfile you need to use docker build to turn it into an image. The build command takes in a directory containing the Dockerfile, executes the steps and stores the image in your local Docker Engine. If one fails because of an error then the build stops.

With the image successfully created, you can now launch the container by using the container runtime like docker run.

``docker run -d -p 80:80 <image-id|friendly-tag-name>``
