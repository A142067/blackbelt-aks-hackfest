# Image Registry

_Type: Presentation_

_Duration: 2 mins_

While you can develop using containers locally on a developer computer, at some point the work will want to be shared across the organization or deployed using CI/CD platforms to Container runtime systems such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm.

A Docker Registry is a storage and content delivery system, holding named Docker images, available in different tagged versions.

Example: the image ``distribution/registry``, with tags ``2.0`` and ``2.1``

Users interact with a registry by using docker push and pull commands.

Example: ``docker pull registry-1.docker.io/distribution/registry:2.1``

There are options for Docker compatible registries for deployment purposes. Docker Hub is the largest public repository. Azure Container Registry is a Cloud hosted Docker registry but is considered a private registry as it requires some level of authentication to push and pull images from the repository. You can also deploy a Docker registry as a service on premises, in your cluster.
