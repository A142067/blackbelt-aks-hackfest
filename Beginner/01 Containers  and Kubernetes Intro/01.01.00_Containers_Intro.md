# What is a Container?
_Type: Presentation_ 

_Duration: 3 mins_

A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Available for both Linux and Windows based apps, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the environment. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example differences between development and staging environments and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure. Docker containers running on a single machine share that machine's operating system kernel; they start instantly and use less compute and RAM. Images are constructed from filesystem layers and share common files. This minimizes disk usage and image downloads are much faster.

* Slice up the OS to run multiple apps on a single VM
* Every container has an isolated view and gets
    * it’s own file system
    * it’s own PID0 and eth0 network interface
* Container and apps share lifecycle
* Shared kernel, very fast start-up, and repeatable execution
* Cannot mix OS

## Comparing Containers to VMs

Containers and virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits, but function differently because containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware. Containers are more portable and efficient.
