# Linux Containers on Azure Workshop

_Delivering modern cloud native applications with ​open source technologies on Azure​_

## Overview

This workshop will guide you through migrating an application from "on-premise" to containers running in Azure Kubernetes Service.

The labs are based upon a node.js application that allows for voting on the Justice League Superheroes. Data is stored in MongoDB.

> Note: These labs are designed to run on a Linux CentOS VM running in Azure (jumpbox) along with Azure Cloud Shell. They can potentially be run locally on a Mac or Windows, but the instructions are not written towards that experience. ie - "You're on your own."

> Note: Since we are working on a jumpbox, note that Copy and Paste are a bit different when working in the terminal. You can use Shift+Ctrl+C for Copy and Shift+Ctrl+V for Paste when working in the terminal. Outside of the terminal Copy and Paste behaves as expected using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.
